# How AnyAPICall Works: A User's Journey

**Understanding the AnyAPICall MCP Server Through Real Examples**

This document explains what actually happens when you use the AnyAPICall MCP server - from the user's perspective, with no technical jargon.

---

## üé¨ **The Setup (One-Time)**

**You (Platform User):**
1. You're on the AgenticLedger platform
2. You see "AnyAPICall" as an available MCP server
3. You click "Connect" or "Enable"
4. Platform asks: "Do you want to use authenticated APIs?"
   - If yes, it shows fields for API keys:
     - OpenWeatherMap API Key (optional)
     - NewsAPI Key (optional)
     - GitHub Token (optional)
   - If no, you just enable it (works with 4 public APIs)

**That's it for setup.** The server is now available to your AI agent.

---

## üí¨ **Scenario 1: Getting Crypto Prices (Public API - No Setup)**

### **You say to your AI agent:**
> "What's the current price of Bitcoin and Ethereum?"

### **What happens behind the scenes:**

**Step 1: Agent Discovers the Tool**
```
Agent thinks: "I need cryptocurrency prices. Let me check what tools I have..."
Agent sees: "make_api_call" tool available
```

**Step 2: Agent Learns About APIs**
```
Agent executes: list_available_apis
Response: "6 APIs available, including CoinGecko for crypto prices"
```

**Step 3: Agent Gets Documentation**
```
Agent executes: get_api_documentation(apiId: 'coingecko')
Response: "CoinGecko API - use /coins/markets endpoint with vs_currency parameter"
```

**Step 4: Agent Makes the API Call**
```
Agent executes: make_api_call({
  apiId: 'coingecko',
  endpoint: '/coins/markets',
  method: 'GET',
  queryParams: {
    vs_currency: 'usd',
    ids: 'bitcoin,ethereum'
  }
})
```

**Step 5: Real API Call Happens**
```
Server ‚Üí CoinGecko API:
GET https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids=bitcoin,ethereum
```

**Step 6: Response Comes Back**
```
CoinGecko ‚Üí Server: [
  { id: 'bitcoin', current_price: 114729, ... },
  { id: 'ethereum', current_price: 4113.86, ... }
]

Server ‚Üí Agent: { success: true, data: {...}, responseTime: 241ms }
```

**Step 7: Agent Responds to You**
```
Agent: "Here are the current prices:
‚Ä¢ Bitcoin (BTC): $114,729 USD
‚Ä¢ Ethereum (ETH): $4,113.86 USD

Both prices are up in the last 24 hours!"
```

**You:** See a nice formatted response in seconds

---

## üå§Ô∏è **Scenario 2: Checking Weather (Needs API Key)**

### **You say:**
> "What's the weather like in Tokyo right now?"

### **What happens:**

**If you didn't set up OpenWeather API key:**
```
Agent executes: make_api_call({ apiId: 'openweather', ... })
Server responds: { success: false, error: "OpenWeatherMap requires authentication..." }
Agent tells you: "I need an OpenWeatherMap API key to check weather. Would you like to add one?"
```

**If you DID set up the API key:**
```
Agent executes: make_api_call({
  accessToken: "your_key_from_platform",  // Platform injects this
  apiId: 'openweather',
  endpoint: '/weather',
  queryParams: {
    q: 'Tokyo',
    units: 'metric'
  }
})

Server ‚Üí OpenWeatherMap:
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Tokyo&units=metric&appid=your_key

Response: { temp: 18.5, weather: "Clear sky", humidity: 65% }

Agent tells you: "Tokyo weather right now:
üå°Ô∏è Temperature: 18.5¬∞C
‚òÄÔ∏è Conditions: Clear sky
üíß Humidity: 65%"
```

---

## üîç **Scenario 3: Complex Multi-Step Request**

### **You say:**
> "Find the most popular Python repositories on GitHub and tell me about the top 3"

### **What happens (step by step):**

**Step 1: Agent searches GitHub**
```
make_api_call({
  apiId: 'github',
  endpoint: '/search/repositories',
  queryParams: {
    q: 'language:python',
    sort: 'stars',
    per_page: 3
  }
})
```

**Step 2: Gets results**
```
Response: [
  { name: 'awesome-python', stars: 180000, owner: {...} },
  { name: 'Python', stars: 55000, owner: {...} },
  { name: 'flask', stars: 65000, owner: {...} }
]
```

**Step 3: Agent fetches details for each repo**
```
For each repo:
  make_api_call({
    apiId: 'github',
    endpoint: '/repos/{owner}/{repo}',
    pathParams: { owner: '...', repo: '...' }
  })
```

**Step 4: Agent presents you with:**
```
"Here are the top 3 Python repositories:

1. awesome-python ‚≠ê 180,000
   - A curated list of awesome Python frameworks and libraries
   - Owner: vinta
   - Last updated: 2 days ago

2. flask ‚≠ê 65,000
   - A lightweight WSGI web application framework
   - Owner: pallets
   - Last updated: 1 week ago

3. Python ‚≠ê 55,000
   - The Python programming language
   - Owner: python
   - Official repository
"
```

## üîó **Scenario 4: Chaining Multiple APIs**

### **You say:**
> "What's the current Bitcoin price and is the weather good in San Francisco?"

### **What happens:**

**Agent thinks:** "This needs 2 different APIs"

**Call 1 - CoinGecko:**
```
make_api_call({ apiId: 'coingecko', endpoint: '/coins/markets', ... })
‚Üí Gets: Bitcoin = $114,729
```

**Call 2 - OpenWeather:**
```
make_api_call({ apiId: 'openweather', endpoint: '/weather', queryParams: { q: 'San Francisco' } })
‚Üí Gets: 22¬∞C, Sunny
```

**Agent responds:**
```
"Bitcoin is currently trading at $114,729 USD (+1.6% today).

The weather in San Francisco is lovely:
üå°Ô∏è 22¬∞C (72¬∞F)
‚òÄÔ∏è Sunny with clear skies
Perfect day to go outside!"
```

---

## üéì **Scenario 5: Agent Learns New APIs**

### **You say:**
> "What APIs can you access?"

### **Agent executes:**
```
list_available_apis()
```

### **Agent sees:**
```
{
  total: 6,
  public: 4,
  authenticated: 2,
  apis: [
    { id: 'coingecko', name: 'CoinGecko', description: 'Crypto prices...', requiresAuth: false },
    { id: 'github', name: 'GitHub', description: 'Repos and users...', requiresAuth: false },
    { id: 'openweather', name: 'OpenWeatherMap', description: 'Weather data...', requiresAuth: true },
    ... 3 more
  ]
}
```

### **Agent tells you:**
```
"I can access these APIs for you:

üåê Public (no setup needed):
‚Ä¢ CoinGecko - Cryptocurrency prices and market data
‚Ä¢ GitHub - Search repositories, get user info, view issues
‚Ä¢ REST Countries - Country information, flags, demographics
‚Ä¢ JSONPlaceholder - Test data and examples

üîê Requires API key (you can add these):
‚Ä¢ OpenWeatherMap - Current weather and forecasts
‚Ä¢ NewsAPI - Breaking news and article search

Would you like me to help with any of these?"
```

---

## üö® **Scenario 6: Error Handling**

### **You say:**
> "Get me data from the FooBar API"

### **What happens:**
```
Agent executes: make_api_call({ apiId: 'foobar', ... })

Server responds: {
  success: false,
  error: "API 'foobar' not found in registry. Available: coingecko, openweather, jsonplaceholder, restcountries, github, newsapi"
}

Agent tells you: "I don't have access to a 'FooBar' API. Here are the APIs I can use:
‚Ä¢ CoinGecko (crypto)
‚Ä¢ GitHub (code)
‚Ä¢ OpenWeatherMap (weather)
‚Ä¢ NewsAPI (news)

## üéì **Teaching Your Agent**

The beauty of AnyAPICall is that agents learn on-the-fly:

**First time:**
```
YOU: "Get Bitcoin price"
AGENT: [Discovers CoinGecko API, learns endpoints, makes call]
AGENT: "$114,729"
```

**Second time:**
```
YOU: "Get Ethereum price"
AGENT: [Already knows CoinGecko, directly makes call]
AGENT: "$4,113"
(Faster - no discovery needed)
```

**Third time:**
```
YOU: "Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum"
AGENT: [Combines knowledge, makes single optimized call]
AGENT: "Bitcoin: $114,729, Ethereum: $4,113, Ratio: 27.9x"
(Even faster - intelligent optimization)
```

**The agent gets smarter with use!** üß†
